                <p className='text-[#696969] poppins-regular text-[15px]'>Our engineers, many of whom are multi lingual, range from level 1 through to level 3 across a broad spectrum of vendor technologies and we pride ourselves on being able to assist in almost any situation. Our global services are provisioned through the use of our own engineers and our highly approved service partners. Servicing client requirements in multiple sectors from simple smart hands engineering to the more complicated consultative approach that enables us to build solutions partnered alongside our clients. But it doesnâ€™t end there, Techkyo can support you in so many other areas for example Datacenter, Unified collaboration, Deskside support with back fill or fixed term and contracted engineers and of course Wireless and Data communications.
